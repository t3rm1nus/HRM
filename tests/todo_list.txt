# Asyncio RuntimeError Fix in L2 Tactical Signal Processor

## Task Overview
Fix the "asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop" error in L2 tactical signal processing by implementing a synchronous wrapper for async FinRL calls.

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Analyze current problematic code (asyncio.run() call around line 947)
- [x] Implement synchronous wrapper using ThreadPoolExecutor for FinRL calls
- [x] Add proper error handling and logging
- [x] Test the fix by running main.py and checking logs for elimination of asyncio errors
- [x] Verify L2 autonomous signals are generated (not just HOLD signals)
