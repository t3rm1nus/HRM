# TensorFlow Import Fix for HRM System

## Problem Description
The HRM system was experiencing a KeyboardInterrupt error during startup when trying to import TensorFlow. The error occurred in the `l3_strategy` module during initialization, specifically when `get_strategic_capabilities()` was called automatically during module import, which in turn called `check_dependencies()` that attempted to import TensorFlow.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **Automatic dependency checking during module import**: The `l3_strategy/__init__.py` file was automatically calling `get_strategic_capabilities()` during module initialization
2. **Synchronous TensorFlow import**: The `check_dependencies()` function was importing TensorFlow synchronously without timeout protection
3. **Module loading blocking**: TensorFlow initialization was taking too long or hanging, causing the KeyboardInterrupt

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added TensorFlow Import Protection
- Created `_check_tensorflow_availability()` function with timeout protection
- Added signal-based timeout for Unix systems (10-second limit)
- Added fallback handling for Windows systems without signal support
- Separated TensorFlow checking from other dependency checks

### 2. Deferred Capability Checking
- Removed automatic call to `get_strategic_capabilities()` during module import
- Changed to lazy loading approach where capabilities are checked only when needed
- Added informative logging message indicating capabilities will be checked when necessary

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added proper exception handling for TensorFlow import failures
- Graceful degradation when TensorFlow is not available or fails to load
- Maintained system functionality even without TensorFlow

## Code Changes Made

### File: `l3_strategy/__init__.py`

1. **Modified `check_dependencies()` function**:
   - Separated TensorFlow checking into dedicated function
   - Added timeout protection for TensorFlow import

2. **Added `_check_tensorflow_availability()` function**:
   - Implements timeout-based TensorFlow import
   - Handles both Unix (signal-based) and Windows systems
   - Returns boolean indicating TensorFlow availability

3. **Updated module initialization**:
   - Removed automatic capability checking during import
   - Added deferred loading message

## Results
- ✅ HRM system now starts successfully without KeyboardInterrupt
- ✅ TensorFlow import is handled gracefully with timeout protection
- ✅ System continues to function even if TensorFlow is unavailable
- ✅ Faster module loading due to deferred dependency checking
- ✅ Maintained all existing functionality

## Testing
Created `test_l3_import.py` script to verify:
- L3 module imports successfully
- Dependency checking works without hanging
- TensorFlow availability is checked safely
- System maintains functionality

## Benefits
1. **Improved Reliability**: System no longer hangs during startup
2. **Better Performance**: Faster module loading with lazy dependency checking
3. **Enhanced Robustness**: Graceful handling of TensorFlow import issues
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All features continue to work as expected
5. **Better Error Handling**: Clear logging and fallback mechanisms

## Future Recommendations
1. Consider implementing similar timeout protection for other heavy ML libraries
2. Add configuration option to disable specific ML frameworks if not needed
3. Implement health checks for ML dependencies during runtime
4. Consider using environment variables to control ML framework loading
